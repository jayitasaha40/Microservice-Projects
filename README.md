# Microservice-Projects

This repository contains projects and examples demonstrating microservice concepts using **Java Spring Boot**. Each project is designed to showcase a specific aspect of microservice architecture, such as service discovery, API gateways, distributed tracing, and more.

---

##  Features and Topics Covered
- **Service Discovery**: Implementing Eureka Server and Client for dynamic service registration and discovery.
- **API Gateway**: Using Spring Cloud Gateway for centralized routing and authentication.
- **Load Balancing**: Implementing client-side load balancing with Spring Cloud LoadBalancer.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Adding resilience with tools like Resilience4j.
- **Distributed Tracing**: Setting up tracing with Zipkin/Sleuth for tracking requests across services.
- **Database Interaction**: Using Spring Data JPA with PostgreSQL.
- **Inter-Service Communication**: REST and Feign client communication between services.
- **Authentication and Security**: Securing microservices with Spring Security and OAuth2 (e.g., Okta integration).
- **Dockerization**: Containerizing microservices using Docker.
